The project that I created is a soundboard that plays 9 different drum loops. I started with a little sketch on a piece of scrap paper and figured out that I wanted 9 buttons with sound, a volume slider, and a power button. I wanted to make something that was definately a challenge but also concievable and possible to complete on time. Originally, looking at the examples that were provided as previous finals, I was really intimidated. They were all super cool, but also so intricate that the thought of this final was stressing me out beyond belief. I have been struggling enough this semester, so I decided that it would be best for me to keep it simpler. A lot of my time on this project was doing research for how to code these aspects: lighten the button when clicked, return to normal when clicked again, when the power was off disable and darken all the buttons, play the sound when a button is clicked, stop the sound when it's clicked again, havfe a moveable and functional volume slider.

I waited until the end to deal wiht the sound, and I had a few issues throuhgout this process. The button clicking didn't work for so long because I had an extra t in "button" and I couldn't see it. I also had some issues with the sound, mainly that the sound wasn't working at all. It took me way too long to realize that I had labled the .wav files as "sound 0" as "sound0" like it was in the coding. Then it was a matter of tiny adjustments to center everything to where I wanted it.
